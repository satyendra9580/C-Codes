// If n is a power of 2 (e.g., 2,4,8,16,...2,4,8,16,...), then all of its divisors are powers of 2, meaning it has no odd divisor greater than 1.

// If n is not a power of 2, then it must have an odd divisor greater than 1.

// A number n is a power of 2 if and only if it has only one set bit in its binary representation.
// This can be checked using bitwise AND:

//     n is a power of 2 if and only if (n&(nâˆ’1))==0.
